## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

1. **Set up virtual environment** on your Pi:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/tortoise-care
   cd ~/tortoise-care
   python3 -m venv tortoise-env
   source tortoise-env/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install PySide6**:
   ```bash
   pip install PySide6
   ```

3. **Clone and run**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SC2IT/Tortoise-Care-Touch.git
   cd Tortoise-Care-Touch
   python main_qt.py --fullscreen
   ```

### Detailed Installation

See [INSTALL_PI.md](INSTALL_PI.md) for comprehensive Pi installation instructions including:
- System dependency setup
- Virtual environment configuration
- Troubleshooting guide
- Auto-start service setup

## Running the Application

### Standard Mode
```bash
cd ~/tortoise-care/Tortoise-Care-Touch
source ~/tortoise-care/tortoise-env/bin/activate
python main_qt.py
```

### Pi Touch Display (Fullscreen)
```bash
python main_qt.py --fullscreen
```

### Development Dependencies
If you need to install additional packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### Database Setup
The application automatically creates an SQLite database on first run. No manual database setup required.

### Adafruit.IO Setup
1. Create an account at [io.adafruit.com](https://io.adafruit.com)
2. Get your API key and username
3. Create feeds for temperature and humidity
4. Configure settings in the application Settings screen

### Mobile Photo Upload System ‚úÖ NEW!
The application includes a built-in web server for easy photo uploads from mobile devices:

1. **Automatic server startup** - Photo server starts automatically with the application
2. **Mobile access** - Connect to the Pi from your phone via WiFi
3. **Simple upload interface** - Drag and drop or browse to upload photos
4. **Direct tortoise association** - Photos are automatically linked to selected tortoises
5. **Local network only** - Secure, no internet required

**How to use:**
- Note the server URL displayed when the app starts (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:5555)
- Visit this URL on your phone's web browser
- Select tortoise and upload photos directly

## Database Structure

The application uses SQLite with tables for:
- Users and tortoise profiles
- Feeding records and plant database  
- Health records and medications
- Growth measurements and photos
- Habitat sensor readings
- Care reminders and tasks
- Application settings

## Development

### Architecture
- `main_qt.py` - Main PySide6 application entry point
- `qt_screens/` - All screen implementations using Qt widgets
- `qt_screens/base_screen.py` - Common UI components and styling
- `database/` - SQLite database management and queries
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

### Adding New Features
The application uses a modular screen-based architecture with Qt's signal/slot system for navigation and data updates.

## Advantages Over Previous Versions

‚úÖ **Reliable Rendering**: Native Qt widgets eliminate UI crashes and broken layouts  
‚úÖ **Professional Appearance**: Native OS styling with consistent theming  
‚úÖ **Better Touch Support**: Proper Qt touch event handling  
‚úÖ **Emoji Icons**: Built-in Unicode support works across all Pi OS versions  
‚úÖ **Performance**: More efficient memory usage and faster rendering  
‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Clean Qt architecture with proper separation of concerns  

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **PySide6 installation fails**: Use virtual environment and see [INSTALL_PI.md](INSTALL_PI.md)
- **Application won't start**: Check Python version and dependencies
- **Touch not working**: Verify Pi Touch Display drivers and calibration
- **Database errors**: Ensure proper file permissions and disk space
- **Sensor connectivity**: Verify Adafruit.IO credentials and network

### Alternative UI Frameworks
If PySide6 doesn't work on your system:
- **PyQt5**: `sudo apt install python3-pyqt5`
- **Tkinter**: Usually pre-installed with Python

### Support
This application is designed specifically for Hermann's tortoise care. For issues or feature requests, please check the documentation or modify the code as needed for your setup.
